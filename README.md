# Checipe Website - Recipes for Vegitarian :herb:

## Reason for Project :eyes:
  - More and more people are eating vegetables because of environment, religion, and health.
  - As a result, food and recipes are becoming more diverse..
  - There are many different kinds of vegetarian, and I wanted to organize these kinds with food.

  - Depending on the variety of vegetarian types, users can check the recipes that they can eat on their own.
